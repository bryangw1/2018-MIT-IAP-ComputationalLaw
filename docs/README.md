## General Course Overview

This MIT-IAP course pursues a cross-disciplinary exploration of the implications of emerging technologies on law and legal processes, with an emphasis on the development and deployment of automated computational business and legal systems.  The course includes special focus areas on rules-driven Artificial Intelligence, Blockchain and Autonomous Transaction Networks.   We will cover a variety of issues, including identification and integration of the business/legal/technical layers or facets of various commercial, industrial, infrastructural, educational, social, political and governmental web-based systems, the complex interaction between governance and sovereignty in public and private sector contexts and the emergence of algorithmic, adaptive methods and mechanisms for regulatory, adjudicative, fiduciary, contractual and other legal processes. The course will entail an intense array of learning and teaching methods. Students will be expected to participate in a variety of activities. As inspiration, we will also attempt to learn from and adopt or adapt aspects of the new join MIT Media Lab and Harvard Law School course on the Ethics and Governance of Artificial Intelligence.  In addition to MIT and Harvard students the course is open to MIT Media Lab and Harvard Berkman Klein Center fellows and affiliates and others approved to audit the course. There are no prerequisites for this course but permission of instructor is required to attend.

## General Course Curriculum

This course provides a conceptual overview and hands-on projects for understanding and solving legal use cases with data analytics, blockchain and other cryptosystems and a special module on rapid design solutions to the Computational Law algorithmic sovereign system challenge. The course includes seminar style lecture/discussion sessions and hands-on, experiential learning through team projects. This course will be conducted primarily online with some in-person sessions held at MIT Media Lab for a limited number of Boston-area registered students.  Depending on available space, some applicants may be offered online The course format includes lectures and other presentations by invited experts with experiential learning activities including small breakout group discussions and team-based project sessions with presentations back to the entire class for feedback and discussion.  The course curriculum covers:

Legal Analytics, including 1) AI/Machine Learning for solving legal use cases; and 2) Using data-driven visualization including AR for display and interaction with models of complex legal and financial relationships and contexts.

Digital Assets, including: 1) Ownership rights, valuation and provenance of digital property; and 2) Storage and exchange of digital property with electronic contracts, automated transactions and autonomous agents

Digital Identity, including: 1) Technology and architecture for autonomy and control of self-sourced digital identity and personal data; and 2) Using individual identity for valid, verifiable login to apps or services and for providing legal acknowledgement, assent or authorization.

Digital Contracts, including 1) Integrating ordinary digital contracts and blockchain "smart contracts" in automated transactions by individuals or businesses; and 2) Standard open-web stack design patterns for executing multiple digital signatures and electronic notarization on digital legal contracts.

## Special Course Project: 2018 Computational Law Design Challenge

Registered students and approved auditors participating in the 2018 MIT-IAP Computational Law course may join a special project team to assist law.MIT.edu with the design and modelling of a novel computational law challenge to design, pilot and evaluate an algorithmic, automated and adaptive public rules system in collaboration with a city and other partners.

They will understand, experience and build the future of law, lawyers, legal services, and societal rules for technologies and methods. Over a handful of weekly first-half (H1) semester class sessions, students will be exposed to key ideas, principles and frameworks from CEOs of leading startups, corporate leaders, and Media Lab instructors who are leading research in the future of computational law, the legal implications of new technologies, the productization of legal services, and more. Throughout the class, participants will benefit from the Media Lab Entrepreneurship Program&rsquo;s ability to convene diverse students from across campus and around Boston.</p>

<h3 id="course-themes" style="font-size: 18px; margin: 0px 0px 10px; color: rgb(102, 102, 102); line-height: 24px; font-family: &quot;Quattrocento Sans&quot;, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;">Course Themes:</h3>

Guest lecturers will reveal how new technologies are creating new areas of opportunity, upsetting established players, transforming existing revenue streams (for both better and worse), and how incumbents are responding to these disruptive innovations.</p>

<p style="margin: 0px 0px 20px; color: rgb(102, 102, 102); font-family: &quot;Quattrocento Sans&quot;, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px;">The course will be explore these top thematic areas:</p>

Some classes will be held in seminar style, with the first half given as a lecture by a practitioner who is a leader in industry, an innovative start-up, government, foundations, or academia. We will round out the second half with frameworks, group exercises and simulations that reinforce the first-half lecture. Other class sessions will consists of mini-presentations led by student groups. The purpose of these demonstrations will be to allow groups to show early progress on their class projects.</p>

<h3 id="class-project" style="font-size: 18px; margin: 0px 0px 10px; color: rgb(102, 102, 102); line-height: 24px; font-family: &quot;Quattrocento Sans&quot;, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;">Class Project:</h3>

Students will form multidisciplinary teams around these topics and will thereafter begin receiving guidance from project mentors and course instructors, including meetings among individuals and groups outside of scheduled class time. Students will spend the rest of the class meeting with their group members and interacting with course staff and outside advisors to complete the group project (see deliverables below). Team coaching from the instructors, outside of regular class meeting times, is integral to the pedagogical design of the course.</p>
